            <h1>Prayatna: Empowering Through Education</h1>
            <p>Prayatna believes that education is the tool that helps society to better itself. As the saying goes, "You educate a woman, you educate a generation." Gender equality is the most important component of achieving a developed nation.</p>

            <h1>Female Students Achieving Great Heights</h1>
            <p>Female students have done exponentially well in the past few years, due to government initiatives and the society opening itself. The girls are doing equally well in competitive exams. While dreaming big, they want to write their own stories. These students have worked hard to clear the JEE, one of the toughest exams in the country. Though, sometimes dreams and hard work are not enough. Once they cleared the exam with flying colours, the financial obstacles stared them in the face. These girls come from a lower strata of the society, where their parents are mostly living a hand-to-mouth existence.</p>

        <h1>Bridging the Gap: Scholarships for Girls</h1>
        <p>To bridge this gap, Prayatna in collaboration with EduGIRLS, came up with these scholarships. The scholarship covered their tuition fees, mess fees and other charges. The aim of the scholarship is to take away the financial burden from the students so that they can concentrate on their studies. When we started this programme, we shortlisted 33 students who were enrolled in premier engineering colleges and institutes.</p>

        <h1>Mentorship Programme: Supporting Transition</h1>
        <p>These girls come from 9 states of the country and different cultures. They were worried about how their parents will afford to send them to another state in the country for studies. The challenges were not only financial, but also mental and emotional. They come from small towns and moving to a bigger city with such fast-paced life, the adoption of the lifestyle was difficult. To help them through these challenges, we started our mentorship programme. The mentorship programme focused on making the transition smoother. It also focused on work readiness, how to draft their CVs and how the job markets work.</p>

        <h1>Scholarship Success Story</h1>
        <p>These girls entered college with their heads high and dream in their eyes. The scholarship took away the burden of them being worried about the financial challenges. The mentorship programme has helped them become confident and believe in themselves. Nandini, a volleyball player in her college team, has visited number of colleges for tournaments. She says, “I am privileged to experience so many different cultures and meet so many people. Few years back I did not expect my life to take such a beautiful turn.” Like Nandini, other students have also joined different sports and cultural societies, which has opened their world. They take part in different activities in college, which are shaping them in a confident and strong woman. </p>

        <h1> From Self-Doubt to Empowerment: A Journey of Confidence and Transformation"</h1>
        <P>I remember my first call with them, they were shy and unsure of themselves. Even achieving a huge feat of cracking JEE and getting into prestigious institutes, they did not believe in themselves. Now, they are ready to face the world with newfound confidence and a will to change their and their families life for better.  </P>
