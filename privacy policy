The present document, replete with detailed provisions, covenants, warranties, and stipulations, constitutes an inseparable and indispensable part of said engagement. Any and all actions taken in relation to the Program, whether through digital mediums, platforms of communication, or personal involvement, shall be construed as express and irrevocable consent to be legally bound by each and every provision contained herein, without reservation or qualification. Furthermore, it is emphasized that these Terms and Conditions may be subject to unilateral modification, augmentation, or abrogation by Prayatna at its sole discretion, with or without notice, and it is incumbent upon the participant to ensure continued compliance through periodic review.

1. Absolute and Irrevocable Binding Nature of Terms

By accessing, utilizing, or in any capacity engaging with the digital platforms, communication conduits, or physical activities pertaining to the Program, you, the participant, hereby unequivocally, expressly, and irrevocably declare that you have examined, understood, and accepted in full the entirety of these Terms and Conditions. The present contractual framework, in its entirety, shall bind all participants, donors, scholars, and third-party affiliates to its strictures, which remain subject to amendment, alteration, or expansion at the exclusive behest of Prayatna. Any such modifications, revisions, or augmentations shall be deemed effective upon their publication on any of the Program’s official channels or websites, irrespective of whether or not individual participants have reviewed or acknowledged such changes. Continued participation subsequent to such modifications shall constitute tacit acceptance of all revisions, rendering any claims of ignorance or misunderstanding inadmissible and void. Consequently, it is the obligation of each participant to vigilantly review these Terms at regular and appropriate intervals to ensure full compliance with any alterations, amendments, or revisions that may be enacted.

2. Conditions of Use and Lawful Conduct Stipulations

Your engagement with the Program, inclusive of but not limited to access to any digital platform, physical activity, or interactive process associated with "Reach for the Stars," is contingent upon strict adherence to these Terms and Conditions and is solely for purposes that are legitimate, lawful, and permissible under applicable laws, statutes, and regulations. It is incumbent upon each participant to refrain from engaging in any activity, action, or omission that may be construed as illegal, unethical, or injurious to the Program’s reputation or the rights of third parties. Specifically, you are enjoined from engaging in actions that infringe, impede, hinder, or restrict the proper functioning of the Program’s digital interfaces, communication systems, or any affiliated technologies.

2.1. Absolute Prohibition of Unauthorized Conduct

Any attempt, whether direct or indirect, to exploit, manipulate, damage, or otherwise compromise the integrity of the Program’s digital platforms, communication networks, or affiliated resources shall be treated as a grave and material breach of these Terms. Such conduct may include, but is not limited to, unauthorized access, hacking, cyber-attacks, dissemination of malware or malicious code, or any similar disruptive activity that impedes the normal operation of the Program. Violations of this provision shall subject the participant to immediate termination of access and may result in civil or criminal liability, including, but not limited to, damages, fines, or penalties under applicable laws.

3. Strict Prohibition on Direct Donor-Scholar Communications

At the heart of the Program’s structural integrity is a categorical prohibition on any direct communication, interaction, or engagement between donors and scholars outside of the official channels provided by Prayatna. This prohibition is non-negotiable and is designed to preserve the transparency, fairness, and accountability of the Program, ensuring that all communication is mediated, supervised, and regulated by Prayatna.

3.1. Requirement for Administrative Mediation

Any and all forms of communication or interaction between donors and scholars must be facilitated exclusively through Prayatna’s designated representatives, with explicit prior authorization. Any deviation from this procedure shall be deemed a flagrant violation of these Terms. Requests for communication between donors and scholars must be submitted in writing to Prayatna, specifying the nature, purpose, and intended outcome of the proposed interaction. Prayatna reserves the absolute right to deny, restrict, or condition any such communication at its sole discretion, without the necessity of providing any explanation or justification.

3.2. Sanctions and Penalties for Unauthorized Contact

In the event that any unauthorized direct contact is discovered—whether initiated by the donor, scholar, or any third party acting on their behalf—Prayatna reserves the unilateral right to impose immediate sanctions, including but not limited to the suspension or revocation of the scholar’s participation in the Program, termination of any scholarships, grants, or financial aid provided, and the imposition of additional penalties as deemed appropriate by Prayatna. Scholars found to have violated this prohibition may be permanently disqualified from future participation in the Program or any other initiatives under the Prayatna umbrella.

4. Obligations of Scholars to Uphold Academic and Ethical Standards

Scholars participating in the Program are subject to an elevated and rigorous standard of conduct, both academically and ethically. Each scholar is expected to exhibit the highest levels of diligence, integrity, and personal responsibility in all aspects of their participation. This requirement is not merely aspirational but is enforced as a binding obligation, the violation of which may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to the termination of financial aid and expulsion from the Program.

4.1. Continuous Performance Monitoring

Prayatna reserves the right to monitor and evaluate each scholar’s academic progress, personal conduct, and adherence to the Program’s guidelines on an ongoing basis. Scholars are expected to maintain exemplary performance in their academic endeavors and to comply with all Program directives and requirements. Failure to meet the expected standards of performance, whether due to negligence, lack of effort, or any other reason, shall be treated as a breach of these Terms and may result in immediate disciplinary measures.

4.2. Requirement for Unrelenting Effort

Each scholar is required, under these Terms, to exert their maximum, unrelenting effort in all academic, extracurricular, and personal endeavors associated with the Program. Scholars must continuously strive to achieve excellence and maintain the highest possible standards of academic performance. Any indication of underperformance, deliberate negligence, or a failure to utilize the resources and opportunities provided by the Program to their fullest extent shall be considered a violation of these Terms and may result in punitive actions.

5. Intellectual Property Rights and Restrictions

All intellectual property associated with the Program, including but not limited to any and all digital content, trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), copyrights, designs, logos, branding, and proprietary materials, shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Prayatna and its licensors. Unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, or modification of any intellectual property is strictly prohibited and constitutes a material breach of these Terms.

Participants are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Program’s digital content for personal, non-commercial purposes. This license does not confer any ownership rights, and all intellectual property shall remain under the exclusive control of Prayatna. Any attempt to modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, or commercially exploit the Program’s intellectual property shall result in the immediate termination of access and may subject the participant to legal action.
